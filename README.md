Q : I want to create a full stack app called “jira-2”. Tech stack will include java spring with gradle, angular, redis, postgresql. The app features will be similar to Jira but simplified.

At first I will have two objects : Issue and IssueType. Please wait with code related to these objects for later.

I want to start development by creating the project structure as a yaml file. I want to start from default empty java spring and angular projects. Please first print the project structure, then a bash mac script that will be able to create needed folders and empty files. I want all the secrets from docker stored in a separate env file. Please include all the files needed for docker in the project structure.
```

```
where is the main backend file ? i want the dockerfiles related to frontend and backend to be in appropriate folders
```

```
Please provide code for all the files related to docker. Indicate where the code should be placed inside the project structure. Remember about exposing appropriate ports. I want all the secrets and variables to be stored and referenced from a separate file
```

```
I want the dockerfiles for the frontend and backend to contain a separate build step and run step. I want the backend to be build using gradle.
```


```agsl
Ok. I want to start on the backend development. Please provide code and/or instruction on how to setup basic java spring application. I want the app to run - but do not have any features yet.
