Q : I want to create a full stack app called “jira-2”. Tech stack will include java spring with gradle, angular, redis, postgresql. The app features will be similar to Jira but simplified.

At first I will have two objects : Issue and IssueType. Please wait with code related to these objects for later.

I want to start development by creating the project structure as a yaml file. I want to start from default empty java spring and angular projects. Please first print the project structure, then a bash mac script that will be able to create needed folders and empty files. I want all the secrets from docker stored in a separate env file. Please include all the files needed for docker in the project structure.
```
